**Slick Cmd** is a lightweight utility designed to supercharge your Windows Command Prompt experience by making directory navigation, path completion, and command management more efficient. Slick Cmd runs quietly in your system tray, enabling you to access its powerful features through intuitive keyboard shortcuts.

## ✨ Features

- **Streamlined Directory Navigation:**
    - `Alt + Up` — Move to the parent directory.
    - `Alt + Down` — Display a popup with a list of subdirectories for quick access.
    - `Alt + Left` — Navigate backward to the previous directory.
    - `Alt + Right` — Navigate forward to the next directory.
    - `Alt + Home` — Jump to the home directory.
    - `Alt + End` — View and navigate to recent directories.

- **Smart Path Completion:**
    - While typing a `cd` command, a path completion list appears, helping you quickly select from available directories.
    - `Esc` — Close the path completion list.
    - `Tab` — Accept the selected path without executing `cd`.
    - `Enter` — Accept the selected path and `cd` into it immediately.

- **Command History Management:**
    - `Alt + F7` — Open the command history dialog to select from previously used commands.
    - `Enter` — Place the selected command in the command line for review or modification.
    - `Ctrl + Enter` — Execute the selected command immediately.
    - Command history persists across sessions, so you can always refer back to previous commands.

- **Auto-Correct for `cd`:**
    - Automatically adds the `/d` flag when switching to a directory on another drive, eliminating the need to remember it manually.

- **Quick Screen Clearing:**
    - `Ctrl + L` — Clear the screen with a single keystroke, running the `cls` command automatically.
